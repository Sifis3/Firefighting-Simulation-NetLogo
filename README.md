# Firefighting Simulation in NetLogo

This project was developed as part of a Distributed Systems course (3rd year, BSc Computer Science) and simulates the complex dynamics between fire spread, firefighter deployment, and grass regrowth using NetLogo.

# Overview

The simulation investigates how varying the number of firefighters, grass regrowth rate, and fire occurrence frequency affects:

- System stability
- Fire suppression efficiency
- Grass coverage over time

Data was analyzed using Python (Pandas) with additional anomaly detection and trend visualizations.

# Objectives

- Understand the impact of resource allocation in a dynamic environment.
- Determine optimal firefighter counts for different environmental conditions.
- Identify system thresholds and tipping points.

# Key Features

- **Agent-based simulation** in NetLogo (v6.4.0).
- **BehaviorSpace automation** for running experiments.
- **Python analysis** with rolling averages, anomaly detection, and visualization.
- **Performance metrics** like time to system stability and firefighter utilization.
