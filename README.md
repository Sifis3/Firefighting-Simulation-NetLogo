# Firefighting-Simulation-NetLogo
A simulation-based project exploring fire suppression dynamics using NetLogo. Includes data analysis with Python and visual insights into agent interactions, resource efficiency, and system stability. Developed as part of a Distributed Systems course in my 3rd year of Computer Science studies.
